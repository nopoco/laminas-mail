`Laminas\Mail` provides generalized functionality to compose and send both text and
MIME-compliant multipart email messages. Mail can be sent with `Laminas\Mail` via
the `Mail\Transport\Sendmail`, `Mail\Transport\Smtp` or the `Mail\Transport\File`
transport. Of course, you can also implement your own transport by implementing
the `Mail\Transport\TransportInterface`.
